#####Notes for users: 

######Preparation and setup
Make sure you have created two folders named "Input" and "Output" next to your project.
Data sets should be placed in the "Input" folder and the outputs will be saved in the "Output" folder.

######Defining a data set
Problem sets should be defined in a text file using the following format and placed in the Input directory:

```
ProdNum=n;
ResNum=m;
Prod_1:CODE,t_11,...,t_1m,D_1,CM_1;
.
.
.
Prod_n:CODE,t_n1,...,t_nm,D_n,CM_m;
Res_1:CODE,C_1,gamma_1;
.
.
.
Res_m:CODE,C_m,gamma_m;
```

######Solving a problem
Put the full name of the data file (including its extension) as an argument in Visual C++ and then run the code. 
Alternatively, you may enter the project name (MPS-TOC) followed by the name of the data set in command line.
